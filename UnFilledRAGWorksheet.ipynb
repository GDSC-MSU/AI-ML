        "\n",
        "Welcome to the world of **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**! Today, we’ll learn how LLMs can get **even smarter** by looking things up. 📚💡  \n",
        "Let’s build a chatbot that can pull in knowledge from outside its brain — just like us using Google during a test (but, uh, legally).\n",

        "## 1. What is RAG?\n",
        "\n",
        "RAG stands for **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**. It’s like giving your chatbot a **superpower** — the ability to look things up before answering! 🦸‍♂️✨\n",
        "\n",
        "Here’s how it works:\n",
        "1. You ask a question 🤔  \n",
        "2. The bot searches a library or document 🗃️  \n",
        "3. It finds the most relevant info 🔍  \n",
        "4. Then it gives you a smart answer based on that info 🧠💬\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2. Why Use RAG?\n",
        "\n",
        "🔒 **LLMs have limits**: They forget stuff, can’t always access the latest info, and sometimes just make things up (weird, right?).\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ **RAG fixes that**: It lets your bot pull in **real documents**, notes, or web pages — whatever you want.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**  \n",
        "Without RAG: “What are MSU’s dining hours?” → *“Uh… not sure.”*  \n",
        "With RAG: → Searches MSU’s dining website → Gives actual hours!\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",

        "## 3. What You Need 🧰\n",
        "\n",
        "- 🧠 A Language Model (like Gemini, GPT, etc.)\n",
        "- 📄 A bunch of documents or web content\n",
        "- 🧲 A way to search those docs (we use **embeddings** + a **vector database**)\n",
